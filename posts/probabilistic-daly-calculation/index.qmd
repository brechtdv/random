# Probabilistic DALY calculations

## Monte Carlo simulations

Monte Carlo simulations are the common standard for quantifying and propagating uncertainty from the inputs to the output. For DALY calculations, this implies that we want to quantify the uncertainty in the incidence, duration, disability weight, mortality, etc, parameters. At each "iteration" of the Monte Carlo process, we then randomly select one "plausible" value for each of these inputs, and apply the DALY calculation formula to this set of plausible values, to obtain one "plausible" DALY estimate. By repeating this process multiple times, we then end up with a distribution of plausible DALY estimates, which reflects the joint uncertainty in the inputs. This resulting empirical distribution of random/plausible DALY estimates can then be summarized e.g. by its mean and a 95% uncertainty interval defined as the 2.5 and 97.5th percentile of the distribution.

```{r}
## settings
set.seed(123) # allows for reproducibility
n <- 1e5      # number of iterations

## define the probability distributions for the inputs
inc <- rgamma(n, 100, 10) # incidence per 100,000
dur <- runif(n, 0.5, 1)    # duration (in years)
dsw <- rbeta(n, 5, 10)     # disability weight
mrt <- rgamma(n, 1, 10)  # mortality per 100,000

## show the uncertainty distributions
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
hist(inc)
hist(dur)
hist(dsw)
hist(mrt)

## we will also use some fixed parameters
pop <- 12000000 # total number of people in population (12M)
rle <- 30       # residual life expectancy at age of death

## calculate DALYs
yld <- pop * (inc/100000) * dur * dsw
yll <- pop * (mrt/100000) * rle
daly <- yld + yll

## show resulting uncertainty distributions
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
hist(yld)
hist(yll)
hist(daly)

## summarize results
mean_ui <-
  function(x, ...) {
    c(mean = mean(x, ...),
      quantile(x, c(0.025, 0.975)))
  }

round(
  rbind(
    YLD = mean_ui(yld),
    YLL = mean_ui(yll),
    DALY = mean_ui(daly)))
